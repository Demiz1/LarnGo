- [ ] Create the vanilla Euler forward function
- [ ] Define a diferential equation (a simple system)
- [ ] Create 3 different system matrices, evaluate them for a cuple of loops and plot their states in a nice way
- [ ] Create A system with inputs ( static input array)
- [ ] Create A system with inputs (let a user decide input)
